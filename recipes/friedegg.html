        <p>An easy to make breakfast! Let's try this simple way to make the perfect fried egg!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>butter</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>black pepper</li>
        
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the butter in a 5 to 8-inch nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium heat until it bubbles and foams, but does not brown. Tilt the pan to evenly distribute.</li>
            <li>Add the cracked egg and lightly season with salt. Immediately cover the pan and cook until the egg white is set, but still glossy on the surface and edges are lightly browned, about 1 Â½ to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat off, leave the cover on and move the pan to the cool side of the stove. Keep the eggs covered until the desired texture is reached, about 30 seconds for a runny yolk, 60 seconds for a soft thickened yolk, or 2 minutes for a medium set, richer yolk.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper and as desired.</li>
        </ol>
