        <p>Sukiyaki is a Japanese dish that is prepared and served in the nabemono style. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>udon noodles</li>
            <li>napa cabbage</li>
            <li>mushroom</li>
            <li>broiled tofu</li>
            <li>sliced beef</li>
            <li>cooking oil</li>
            <li>soy sauce</li>
            <li>mirin</li>
            <li>sake</li>
        
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the sake, mirin, sugar, and soy sauce in a small saucepan and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, turn off the heat and set it aside. This Sukiyaki Sauce can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a month.</li>
            <li>If using dry udon noodles, cook them according to the package directions. In either case, remove the cooked udon from the heat, drain, and soak in iced water to stop the cooking. Drain, transfer to a plate, and cover with plastic. You will not need it until the end of the sukiyaki meal.</li>
            <li>Prepare the sukiyaki ingredients. Cut the napa cabbage 2 inches (5 cm) wide, then cut the pieces in half down along the thick white center of the leaves.</li>
            <li>Cut the rest of the vegetables into chunks</li>
            <li>Heat a cast-iron sukiyaki pot (or any pot) on medium heat. When it is hot, add 1 Tbsp cooking oil </li>
            <li>Place 2-4 slices of well-marbled beef in the pot to sear and sprinkle 1 Tbsp brown sugar on top. Flip and cook the other side of the meat. I recommend that you pour a little bit of the sukiyaki sauce over the meat and enjoy some (or all) of the sweet and caramelized meat now to consume this good-quality beef at its best. Or you can leave the meat in the pot and continue to the next step.</li>
            <li>Pour half of the sukiyaki sauce you made (1â…“ cups) and 1 cup dashi (or water) into the pot.</li>
            <li>Add the vegetables, tofu, and other ingredients to the pot (keep the udon for later). The ingredients should be partially submerged in the broth, about two-thirds of the way; add more sauce or dashi (or water) if necessary. Put the lid on and bring it to a gentle boil. Once boiling, turn down the heat and simmer until the ingredients are cooked through. At this point, you can add more beef, as it cooks fast. Transfer the cooked ingredients to the individual bowls and enjoy the first round of sukiyaki.</li>
        </ol>
